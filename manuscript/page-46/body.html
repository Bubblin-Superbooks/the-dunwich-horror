<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">can no man know, <em>saving only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind</em>; and of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is <em>They</em>. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. <em>IÃ¤ Shub-Niggurath!</em> As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold. <em>Yog-Sothoth</em> is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now</blockquote></div> </div>
